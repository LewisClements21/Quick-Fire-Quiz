# Quick-Fire Quiz

Quick-Fire is an online quiz game that allows users to test their knowledge in a quiz where they are given the option of 4 catagories to answer questions from. Upon finishing the quiz, the user's score is saved into local storage and is displayed at the very end so the user can see their final score. This coupled with the different catagories adds an element of replayability to the quiz. On top of this users can challenge themselves to improve their performance and continue learning.
